Many of the simple .xaml files can be double-clicked and viewed in Internet Explorer.
Others cannot (under default security policy) due to using features such as a Window, or because they use features specific to WPF 3.5 or WPF 4.
To view these, you should paste the content into Visual Studio or any XAML-viewing tool mentioned in the book.
For examples that reference images, you'll need to update the path so they can be found.
