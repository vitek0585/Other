    In movies and on TV, the main characters are typically
    an exaggeration of the people you encounter in real life.
    They're more attractive, they react quicker, and they
    somehow always know exactly what to do. The same could
    be said about the software they use.

  <Paragraph>
    This first struck me back in 1994 when watching the movie
    Disclosure, starring Michael Douglas, Demi Moore, and an
    email program that looks nothing like Microsoft Outlook!
    Throughout the movie, we're treated to various visual
    features of the program: a spinning three-dimensional "e,"
    messages that unfold when you open them and crumple
    when you delete them, hints of inking support, and slick
    animations when you print messages. (The email program
    isn't even the most unrealistic software in the movie. I'll
    just say "virtual reality database" and leave it at that.)

  <Paragraph>
    Usability issues aside, Hollywood has been telling us for a
    long time that software in the real world isn't as
    compelling as it should be. You can probably think of
    several examples on your own of TV shows and movies
    with comically unrealistic software. But real-world software
    is starting to catch up to Hollywood's standards! You can
    already see it in traditional operating systems (such as Mac
    OS and more recently Windows Vista), in software for
    devices such as TiVo or Xbox, and on the Web thanks to
    Adobe Flash. Users have increasing expectations for the
    experience of using software, and companies are spending
    a great deal of time and money on user interfaces that
    differentiate themselves from the competition.

  <Paragraph>
    Microsoft now has a solution for helping people create 21st-century software that meets
    these high demands, using less time and less money. This solution is Windows
    Presentation Foundation (WPF).
