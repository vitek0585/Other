        <Paragraph>
          In movies and on TV, the main characters are typically
          an exaggeration of the people you encounter in real life.
          They're more attractive, they react quicker, and they
          somehow always know exactly what to do. The same could
          be said about the software they use.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          This first struck me back in 1994 when watching the movie
          Disclosure, starring Michael Douglas, Demi Moore, and an
          email program that looks nothing like Microsoft Outlook!
          Throughout the movie, we're treated to various visual
          features of the program: a spinning three-dimensional "e,"
          messages that unfold when you open them and crumple
          when you delete them, hints of inking support, and slick
          animations when you print messages. (The email program
          isn't even the most unrealistic software in the movie. I'll
          just say "virtual reality database" and leave it at that.)
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Usability issues aside, Hollywood has been telling us for a
          long time that software in the real world isn't as
          compelling as it should be. You can probably think of
          several examples on your own of TV shows and movies
          with comically unrealistic software. But real-world software
          is starting to catch up to Hollywood's standards! You can
          already see it in traditional operating systems (such as Mac
          OS and more recently Windows Vista), in software for
          devices such as TiVo or Xbox, and on the Web thanks to
          Adobe Flash. Users have increasing expectations for the
          experience of using software, and companies are spending
          a great deal of time and money on user interfaces that
          differentiate themselves from the competition.

          Microsoft now has a solution for helping people create 21st-century software that meets
          these high demands, using less time and less money. This solution is Windows
          Presentation Foundation (WPF).
